Using a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) in python with Pandas, 
NumPy, MatPlot & Seaborn, see if there exists a correlation between:
A) Budget of the movie and the eventual Gross Revenue
B) Company that produces the picture and the Gross Revenue

Includes some data cleanup and housekeeping, as well as numerization and plotting data on graphs.
